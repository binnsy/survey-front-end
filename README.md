Would You Rather Survey

Team name: “The Full-Stack Pancakes”

Our team has created a “Would You Rather Survey” platform that allows you to sign-in, create your own survey with questions and answers, update your survey, delete your survey, and view your surveys along with any you have taken. As a signed-in user, you are also able to see other user’s surveys and complete them.

Planning:
After being assigned the project prompt for creating a survey, we all went home and created our own wireframes and ideas of the project we had envisioned. The next day we collaborated our thoughts and visions into one wireframe. Everyone had something unique to contribute. We then split up the main chunks of the front end and back end, planned our scrums, standups, pull-requests, and made sure on the first day we all had a commit on the front-end and back-end.

Challenges/Obstacles:

A lot of our challenges stemmed from who was going to work on what and how we were going to work at the same time. When we first started out, we stuck together with the boiler plate material because we were not quite comfortable branching off. As time progressed, we were able to work closely, but still separately with all of us working on the front end at once by the end. This was the first time we had all worked together in a group setting for a project and although we ran into a few conflicts here and there, we weren’t afraid of them.
